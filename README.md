## About us

Norweez is an ocean metaverse with all assets stored on Polygon. You will be able to explore the sea world with a first-person perspective and later using an in-game character so you can interact with other players through hangouts, games, or events.

Our mission is to aid initiatives that help save the oceans and seas in any way from pollution reduction to charting endangered species. 

Norweez is a community-driven project featuring an NFT art collection of 5000 Norweez that double as your identity to access the ocean metaverse, buy sea-land and be part of a community of like-minded individuals where you vote for experiences, roadmap activations and projects you want to invest in.
